Home to the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=16–17}} Four of the world's major religions—[[Hinduism in India|Hinduism]], [[History of Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], [[Statistics of Jainism|Jainism]], and [[Sikhism in India|Sikhism]]—originated here, whereas [[Parsi|Zoroastrianism]], [[Christianity in India|Christianity]], and [[Islam in India|Islam]] arrived in the 1st millennium [[Common Era|CE]] and also helped shape the region's [[Indian culture|diverse culture]]. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the [[Company rule in India|British East India Company]] from the early 18th century and [[British Raj|administered directly by the United Kingdom]] from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] that was marked by [[non-violent resistance]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]].

However, it continues to face the challenges of [[poverty in India|poverty]], [[Literacy in India|illiteracy]], [[Corruption in India|corruption]], and [[Healthcare in India|inadequate public healthcare]]. A [[nuclear weapons state]] and a [[Power (international relations)#Power as status|regional power]], it has the [[List of countries by number of troops|third-largest standing army]] in the world and ranks [[List of countries by military expenditures|ninth in military expenditure]] among nations. India is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]] consisting of [[States and territories of India|28 states and 7 union territories]].

It is also home to a diversity of [[Wildlife of India|wildlife]] in a variety of [[Protected areas of India|protected habitats]]. ==Etymology== {{Main|Names of India}} The name ''India'' is derived from ''Indus'', which originates from the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] word ''[[Hindu]]''. The latter term stems from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Sindhu'', which was the historical local appellation for the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Oxford English Dictionary}} The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] referred to the Indians as ''Indoi'' (Ινδοί), which translates as "the people of the Indus".{{sfn|Kuiper|2010|p=86}} The geographical term ''Bharat'' ({{IPA-hns|ˈbʱaːrət̪|pron|hi-Bharat.ogg}}), which is recognised by the [[Constitution of India]] as an official name for the country, is used by [[Names of the Republic of India in its official languages|many Indian languages]] in various subtle guises.{{sfn|Ministry of Law and Justice 2008}} The [[eponym]] of ''Bharat'' is [[Bharata (emperor)|Bharata]], a mythological figure that Hindu scriptures describe as a legendary emperor of ancient India. ''[[Hindustan]]'' ({{IPA-hns|ɦɪnd̪ʊˈst̪aːn||Hindustan.ogg}}) was originally a [[Persian language|Persian]] word that meant "Land of the Hindus"; prior to 1947, it referred to a region that encompassed northern India and Pakistan. It is occasionally used to solely denote India in its entirety.{{sfn|Kaye|1997|pp=639–640}}{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}} ==History== {{Main|History of India|History of the Republic of India}} ===Ancient India=== The earliest [[Anatomically modern humans|anatomically modern human]] remains found in South Asia date from approximately 30,000 years ago.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=64}} Nearly contemporaneous [[Mesolithic]] rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, including at the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=89–93}} Around 7000 BCE, the first known [[Neolithic]] settlements appeared on the subcontinent in [[Mehrgarh]] and other sites in western Pakistan.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|pp=24–25}} These gradually developed into the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley Civilisation]],{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=21–23}} the first urban culture in South Asia;{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=181}} it flourished during 2500–1900&nbsp;BCE in Pakistan and western India.{{sfn|Possehl|2003|p=2}} Centred around cities such as [[Mohenjo-daro]], [[Harappa]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Kalibangan]], and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=181}} [[File:Indischer Maler des 6. Jahrhunderts 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Damaged brown painting of a reclining man and woman.|Paintings at the [[Ajanta Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]], 6th century]] During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the [[Chalcolithic]] to the [[Iron Age]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} The [[Vedas]], the oldest scriptures of Hinduism,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186–187}} were composed during this period,{{sfn|Witzel|2003|pp=68–69}} and historians have analysed these to posit a [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]] in the [[Punjab region]] and the upper [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic Plain]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of [[Indo-Aryan migration]] into the subcontinent from the north-west.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=31}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=186–187}}{{sfn|Stein|2010|p=47}} The [[caste system]], which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during this period.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=41–43}} On the [[Deccan Plateau]], archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=255}} In southern India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of [[megalith]]ic monuments dating from this period,{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250–251}} as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=250–251}} In the late Vedic period, around the 5th century BCE, the small chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the ''[[mahajanapada]]s''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=53–54}} The emerging urbanisation and the orthodoxies of this age also created the religious reform movements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54–56}} both of which became independent religions.{{sfn|Thapar|2003|p=166}} Buddhism, based on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=54–56}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=67–68}} Jainism came into prominence around the same time during the life of its exemplar, [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=312–313}} In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up [[Nekkhamma|renunciation]] as an ideal,{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=300}} and both established long-lasting monasteries.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]].{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=78–79}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=70}} The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for [[Ashoka]]'s renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]]''.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=367}}{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|p=63}} The [[Sangam literature]] of the [[Tamil language]] reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was being ruled by the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], and the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyas]], dynasties that traded extensively with the [[Roman Empire]] and with [[Western Asia|West]] and [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=89–90}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|pp=408–415}} In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=319}} By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Gupta Empire]] had created in the greater Ganges Plain a complex system of administration and taxation that became a model for later Indian kingdoms.{{sfn|Kulke|Rothermund|2004|pp=89–91}}{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=98–99}} The renewal was reflected in a flowering of [[Sculpture in the Indian subcontinent|sculpture]] and [[Architecture of India|architecture]], which found patrons among an urban elite.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} [[Sanskrit literature#Classical Sanskrit literature|Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowered as well, and [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|Indian science]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Ayurveda|medicine]], and [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] made significant advances.{{sfn|Singh|2009|p=545}} ===Medieval India=== [[File:Big Temple-Temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The granite [[gopuram|tower]] of [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]] was completed in 1010 CE by [[Raja Raja Chola I]].]] The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=132}} When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=119–120}} When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=119–120}} When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=119–120}} No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=132}} During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=121–122}} The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=121–122}} In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [[Bhakti|devotional hymns]] were created in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=123}} They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all [[Languages of India|modern languages of the subcontinent]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=123}} Indian royalty, [[Maharaja|big]] and [[Samanta|small]], and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=124}} Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=124}} By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]].{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=127–128}} Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.{{sfn|Stein|1998|pp=127–128}} After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [[courser (horse)|swift-horse]] cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1206.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p=68}} The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=47}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=6}} By repeatedly repulsing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol raiders]] in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.{{sfn|Ludden|2002|p=67}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|pp=50–51}} The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=53}} Embracing a strong [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=12}} and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=53}} ===Early modern India=== [[File:Moghul.1590-95гг.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scribes and artists in the Mughal court, 1590–1595]] In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers,{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=80}} fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=164}} The resulting [[Mughal Empire]] did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=115}}{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=90–91}} and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=17}} leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=152}} Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under [[Akbar]], the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=17}} The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=158}} and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,{{sfn|Stein|1998|p=169}} caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=152}} The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=152}} resulting in greater patronage of [[Mughal painting|painting]], literary forms, textiles, and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]].{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=186}} Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], the [[Rajputs]], and the [[Sikh empire|Sikhs]], gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=23–24}} Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=23–24}} As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=256}} By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English [[East India Company]], had established coastal outposts.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=286}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=44–49}} The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the [[Bengal]] region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=98–100}}{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=286}}{{sfn|Ludden|2002|pp=128–132}}{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=51–55}} Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=68–71}} India was now no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the British empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=286}} By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration, the Company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.{{sfn|Asher|Talbot|2008|p=289}} ===Modern India=== [[File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|The British Indian Empire, from the 1909 edition of ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]''.

The appointment in 1848 of [[Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor General of the [[Company rule in India|East India Company rule in India]] set the stage for changes essential to a modern state.
